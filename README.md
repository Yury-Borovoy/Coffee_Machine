# Coffee-Machine

This is my first project, which simulates a coffee machine. The machine has next parameters:
1. water;
2. milk;
3. beans;
4. cups;
5. money.

Depending on the quantity of the first three parameters we can make several kinds of coffee:
1. espresso;
2. latte;
3. cappuccino.

Each kind of coffee needs a different quantity of ingredients. If the machine doesn't have enough ingredients, we will see a message, for example:
### "Sorry, not enough milk!"

After a good working day we can take out some money from the coffee machine (the parameter 'money'). If we do it, the program will give us the next message:
### "I gave you $n"

This project is completed in one class. Each action has its own method.
